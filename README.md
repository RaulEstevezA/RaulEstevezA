Although my professional career began outside the technology sector, I have completed a full professional transition into software development through intensive academic training and hands-on project work.

I have successfully completed the Higher National Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), graduating with a final GPA of 9.3 / 10.

I have also completed Harvard University's CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (edX), strengthening my foundation in AI concepts, search algorithms, optimization, and machine learning fundamentals.

My work is primarily focused on backend development, software architecture, and applied artificial intelligence.
