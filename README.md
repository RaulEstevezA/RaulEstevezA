Although my professional career began in a field unrelated to technology, in recent years I have devoted all my efforts to training in programming and software development. This constant dedication reflects my commitment to a solid and lasting professional transition toward the field of programming, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence.  
My goal is to complete a full transition into software and AI development, areas that represent my true vocation.

Over this process, I have completed more than twenty certified courses covering **Python, C, Java, Django, databases, artificial intelligence, and machine learning**.  

I am currently studying for a **Higher National Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)** at the **Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)**, combining my academic work with the development of personal and academic projects focused on professional practice.  
I am expected to complete this program in **February 2026**.

### What Iâ€™m currently working on

- **CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**, by Harvard University (edX).  
- **IBM Full Stack Application Development (MicroBachelors, edX)**, focused on the complete development of web applications using **React, Node.js, Express, and databases**. Associated repositories:  
  - [expressBookReviews](https://github.com/RaulEstevezA/expressBookReviews)  
  - [e-plantShopping](https://github.com/RaulEstevezA/e-plantShopping)  
- Advanced subjects from the **DAM** program, focused on:
  - Object-oriented programming with databases.  
  - Data persistence techniques with .NET and ERP systems.  
  - Internet of Things (IoT).  
  - Native mobile application development.  
  - Design and programming of video games in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR).  
- Preparation for the **official C1 English certification** and future certifications in **Swift** and **Flutter**.

### Learning path

My training is mainly focused on **backend development**, although I have also worked on **full stack** projects using **React** and **JavaScript** for the client side.  
This combination allows me to understand the entire application development cycle, from data management to user experience.

- More than **60 credits completed** in the DAM program with excellent academic performance.  
- Complementary training in **artificial intelligence, data science, and web development**, completed through **Harvard, IBM, and other institutions via edX**.  
- Participation in academic projects simulating real business environments, including:  
  - **Deployment of Windows and OpenLDAP domains** using Docker in simulated networks.  
  - **Development of a commercial management system in Java** (*WoodShops* case study).  
  - Creation of documented repositories such as [HARVARD_IA](https://github.com/RaulEstevezA/HARVARD_IA) (coming soon), focused on artificial intelligence with Python.
